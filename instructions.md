# Guidelines for Developers for Code Repositories

## Product Objective: New JSON Generation Based on Existing JSON and Markdown

The product's next evolution focuses on enabling a new functionality: generating a specific JSON file derived programmatically from the current collection of JSON and Markdown files within the codebase. This JSON output will directly support a feature you’ve requested, aligning with existing workflow patterns found in automation scenarios—chiefly those observed in content aggregation and AI-driven summarization within the product ecosystem.

## Key Source Materials

The repository demonstrates a successful pattern of using both workflow JSON files (like `news_generator.json`, `automated_social.json`) for automation logic and Markdown files (notably in the `documentation/` folder) for documentation and schema examples. The new feature's reliability and utility hinge on robust extraction and correct transformation from these sources.

## Intended Business Value

This new JSON generation process is designed to streamline integration, automate data aggregation, and support broader workflows, such as targeted news distribution, campaign automation, or intelligent content routing. By leveraging existing human-written Markdown documentation and previously defined workflow JSONs, the system maximizes internal knowledge reuse and expedites onboarding for new features.

## Process Flow Overview

The process targets automation, accuracy, and maintainability. Below is a representative flow reflecting the anticipated business logic:

## Clean Code Guidelines for Developers

To accelerate product velocity and support maintainability, the development team should:

-   Apply precise naming for fields and variables that correspond to business terms (e.g., "campaign", "workflow", "summary").
    
-   Enforce single-responsibility in transformation modules to simplify updates as the underlying business logic evolves.
    
-   Avoid redundancy in parsing and extraction logic to minimize maintenance overhead as the system scales with new sources.

## Data Consistency and Quality Assurance

Data consistency is critical. The product should ensure:

-   Alignment between the new JSON’s structure and the documented schemas in Markdown.
    
-   Automated validation routines that compare generated output against examples and templates contained in the documentation folder.
    
-   Clearly defined error-handling strategies to surface actionable errors to non-technical stakeholders.

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The feature seamlessly plugs into the automation ecosystem observed in files like `news_generator.json`. Outputs from the new generation logic become inputs for:

-   Automated Slack notifications
    
-   AI summarization workflows
    
-   External API integrations or scheduled campaigns
    

This immediate operability eliminates workflow breaks, shortening time-to-value for feature rollouts.

## Documentation Strategy

Documentation is central to developer and business success:

-   All input expectations (both JSON and Markdown structure) must be documented in the style of `n8ndocs.md`, ensuring business and technical teams share a singular understanding.
    
-   Example outputs illustrating both correct and incorrect input scenarios will be maintained to speed up troubleshooting and product education.

## Stakeholder Roles & Review Process

The product owner sets requirements for the JSON schema and its intended downstream uses. Developers implement and test according to clean code and schema guidelines. QA ensures all transformations adhere to business logic, while technical writers keep documentation current.

Review checklists during implementation and code review will include:

-   Schema conformance
    
-   Field clarity and mapping correctness
    
-   Maintainability and testability against representative data

## Testing and Release Management

Product managers are empowered to validate the feature by reviewing:

-   Test reports from simulated scenarios based on real workflow JSONs and Markdown documentation.
    
-   Confirmation that the new JSON outputs align with intended business routines.
    
-   Results from edge-case tests for missing or malformed input files.
    

This checklist is critical for sign-off prior to deployment.

## Post-Launch Success Metrics

Key product-level metrics for evaluating success include:

-   Percentage reduction in manual configuration errors in automation workflows.
    
-   Time savings in onboarding new campaigns or workflows using the new JSON generation.
    
-   Feedback from business users and developers on clarity and coverage of the documentation.
    

Ongoing monitoring focuses not on error rates in code execution, but on whether the feature accelerates achievement of business objectives like rapid campaign launches, improved content accuracy, and reduced support tickets related to workflow setup.

## Visualizing Stakeholder & Process Relationships



## Feature Evolution and Backwards Compatibility

Given the automation-first nature of the workflows, the system must safeguard backwards compatibility. The design should allow incremental inclusion of new data points or schema fields without invalidating previous automations or documentation references, protecting existing business processes from disruption.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

-   **Data drift:** Regular QA audits against documentation prevent schema drift.
    
-   **Inconsistent source files:** Validation routines flag and isolate problematic Markdown or JSON sources for manual review.
    
-   **Documentation lag:** Product managers align feature rollouts closely with documentation updates to ensure sustained clarity.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

This enhancement is a pivotal step in automating and simplifying product workflows, anchored in current real-world automation logic. Through rigorous guidelines, robust documentation, and a focus on business impact, the new JSON generation feature will drive operational efficiency, reduce manual work, and support future product innovation paths.
